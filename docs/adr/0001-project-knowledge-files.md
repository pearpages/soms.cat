# 0001. Project knowledge lives in principles, architecture, decisions, tasks and security

- **Date:** 2026-09-25
- **Status:** Accepted

## Context

Agents and people need to find how to work here, the rules, how it is built, why choices
were made, what is open and what the risks are. Left alone, that knowledge piles up in the
agent instruction file as a session log, where it is hard to find and never pruned.

## Decision

- `AGENTS.md` holds how to work here and pointers — nothing else. `CLAUDE.md` only imports
  `AGENTS.md` and `principles.md`, so Claude Code always loads the rules; other agents read
  `AGENTS.md` and follow its links.
- `principles.md` — rules every change follows. `architecture.md` — how it is built.
  `decisions.md` + `docs/adr/` — why. `tasks.md` — Open / Done. `security.md` — threat
  surface, secrets, dependencies, reporting. `README.md` — for users. `LICENSE` when the
  project is distributed.

## Consequences

+ Every kind of knowledge has one home; any agent finds it from `AGENTS.md`.
+ Principles are always in Claude's context without duplicating them.
− Six files to keep current; the working rules in `AGENTS.md` make updating them part of
  every change.
